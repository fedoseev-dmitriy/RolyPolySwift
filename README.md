# RolyPolySwift

This is a Google Now inspired card list view controller. It is intended to be similar to a table view controller except that entries in the list are animated into place and you can swipe to delete any element of the list.

This is still, very much, a work in progress.

This ported to swift https://github.com/martega/roly-poly
